If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
"Audio aura " is subjective. You could avrege out energy, valence, and danceability of your top 100 songs, then those averages could be placed on a arbitrary scale that could determin ones mood.
For example if the avrage danceability is high, then one can asume the listner is happy.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
One should also consider other atributes in db like genres and artists, these atributes imo are better at determining mood because artist and ganaras naturaly describes mood or "aura"
e.i. romantic, rock, dance etc.
