Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

None, small change on smaller n of sims, sims getting loonger the bigger n is. Not linear increase, when increasing n from 100k to 1m, gives x6 increase.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

1k or 10k after that the results are prety much the same.
